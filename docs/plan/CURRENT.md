# Amanda TFG BIM Agent — Current Implementation Plan

## P0 — Repository Recovery (complete)

Repository recovery closed on 2026-09-24. The recovery report records branch consolidation, preservation tags, the single worktree, document migration, source/evidence/RVT retention, focused validation, and remote verification. No Revit/model action occurred during P0.

## P1 — Four-board reconciliation (P1-T01 complete)

P1-T01 binds exactly the four canonical boards and reconciles implantation, administration floors, residential pavilion membership, the curved service/capacitation courtyard, child-sector contents, and the official program. Its report records unresolved board-to-program differences without changing official areas. No Revit work or new solution identity was created.

## P2 — New canonical solution (P2-T01 complete)

P2-T01 assigned `AMANDA-RUN-003-PAVILION-CANONICAL-4B1275558A6C`, bound to exactly the four current canonical board hashes, the official program PDF hash, and the P1-T01 reconciliation report identity. The machine-readable record is `project/requirements/canonical-solution-identity.yaml`; `PROJECT_STATE.selected_design` remains null. This identity-only task created no layout or approval hash and authorized no BIM-00 or Revit write.

## P3 — Canonical QA and approval

P3-T01 is the next authorized task and remains pending. It will pass the non-Revit four-board hard checks and, if they are green, generate the new layout and selection approval hashes. P3-T01 was not started during P2-T01 closeout.

## P4 — BIM-00

Authorize only the exact new solution and target.

## P5 — R04 Revit

Create canonical massing, save, close, reopen, and query.

## P6 — R04 visual/geometric acceptance

Compare real Revit output to all four boards. R05 is blocked until PASS.

## P7 — Detailed production

Run R05 through R13 with required regression gates.

## P8 — QA/RC

Run R14, R15 cold reopen, and exports.

## P9 — GOLDEN

Run R16 only after every required gate and documented deviation passes.

P0, P1-T01, and P2-T01 are closed. `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` is the formal pointer and names pending P3-T01. Historical plans are archive material in Git history, not a second instruction source.
